# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis is to display differences in multiple facets of PyBer between city types. Distinguishing the differences between the data between city types can help analyze metrics in order to improve profits within PyBer.
## Results
  Using the summary dataframe, we can look into all important metrics across all city types to compare and contrast:

  As displayed by the data, we can see that Urban communities tend to have the most rides, drivers, and total fares as a whole. Urban cities are leading in these aspects, but we see large differences in all averages when compared to suburban and rural cities. Rural cities lead in all averages (Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver) by a considerable margin. Average Fare per ride was around 1.4x higher for rural cities versus urban cities. The difference in average fare per driver is much larger at around 3.35x for rural cities versus urban cities.
## Total Fares by City Type

  Using this chart, we can visualize the total fares by city. We can see that in terms of total fares, urban cities are far above the rest. Suburban communities are second most and rural is the lowest. Trends in average fare generally follow a similar trend across all city types. All city types see a similar spike towards the end of February, which could be associated with an event in the area around the cities that the data was collected from. 
## Sumnmary
  By looking at the analysis of each city type, we can see that for the company the most profitable cities are urban but for the drivers the most profitable cities are rural. Multiple things could be contributing to this. Rural cities tend to be more spread out and require longer ride times which cause a higher ride cost on average. Also, due to the a large number of drivers in urban areas due to population density, there is more competiton for drivers finding rides which causes the average fare per driver to decrease. A way to make profits more equal for drivers and the company as a whole is to charge lower amounts per mile for rural cities and higher amounts per mile for urban cities. An increase in advertising for driving for PyBer in rural cities could also allow for more drivers to come in. In the same sense, advertising for the app in urban cities could bring in more ride requests allowing more drivers access to rides. Ideally, all three of these could be implimented to keep a good public opinion of the company by both drivers and customers.
